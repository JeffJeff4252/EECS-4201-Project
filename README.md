**RV32I In-Order RISC-V Core**
<u>Overview</u>

This project implements a 32-bit in-order RISC-V processor core supporting the RV32I base integer instruction set. The design follows a modular and testable hardware architecture, with an emphasis on correctness, clarity, and robust verification.

The project is developed as part of EECS 4201 and follows the structure, starter code, and build/test infrastructure provided in the official project repository:

Please refer to the README on the GitHub landing page above for details on the framework, directory structure, and provided tooling. Note that this project was completed in Fall 2025. More PDs content, and test cases may have been added since then.

Project Objectives
-Design and implement a functional RV32I-compliant RISC-V core
-Use an in-order execution pipeline
-Adhere to good hardware design and coding practices
-Thoroughly verify functionality using testbenches
-Maintain the project using version control (now just PDs available for public view)

Features
-32-bit RISC-V architecture
-RV32I instruction set support
-In-order execution
-Modular design for ease of debugging and extension
-Compatible with the provided build and test infrastructure
